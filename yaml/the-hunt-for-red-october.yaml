thoughts: >
  Seemed like a rather good film, though I must confess my attention waned a
  little in parts. Successfully handled action, tension, and character moments
  with a solid plot. Only complaint would be that the effects shots now look
  rather dated but that can't really be held against it, and that it really
  didn't hold my attention as much as it could have.
