thoughts: >
  Rather odd. The humour was very slapstick and the characters particularly
  unbelievable, and yet the film had a certain charm that made it particularly
  watchable. The short length of this film probably helped towards this, as I
  don't think it would have worked had it been longer. It was not what I was
  expecting, though.
