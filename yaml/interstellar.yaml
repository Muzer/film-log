  Very mixed. I disagree with popular opinion of the film, in that I don't
  think it's particularly great. It seems like it's trying to be 2001 but
  failing. I watched this back-to-back with 2001 (a film that I have already
  seen so not listed here), and the differences really stood out like a sore
  thumb. Whereas 2001 had sci-fi bits and bits where it basically went "OK,
  this is magic, you'll just have to accept it" kept separate enough so as not
  to interfere with each other, Interstellar tried to pass off magic AS sci-fi,
  which is inexcusable. The film looked visually stunning, and the music was
  passable (though the chords stolen from the end of Also Spracht  Zarathustra
  seemed a little cheap), although it did sometimes drown out the dialogue; but
  the plot was full of holes and not particularly engaging, and the characters
  were SO cheesy and unreal. The "science" was cringeworthy in places, though
  the visual effects (wormhole and black hole) were once again outstanding in
  this respect. The denouement went on for far too long, and I was actually
  bored by the end of it, and glad when it was finally succeeded by the rather
  odd (not in a good way) coda. That's not to say it's a really BAD film — it's
  possible to watch it and enjoy yourself for at least the most part — but it
  really doesn't live up to its reputation, in my own opinion.
