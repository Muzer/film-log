  Lol. It was ridiculously short and rather surreal, quite funny to watch. It
  missed out major points of the book, but the bits it did include were
  surprisingly faithful, appearing to mostly use translated lines from the
  books (though admittedly this may be more to do with the fan translation I
  was watching). The effects, of course, were terrible, and there were some
  facepalmingly bad scenes and changes. The acting was terrible, the costumes
  and scenery were terrible, and the story made little sense with many of the
  parts cut out. But there was a certain "so bad it's good" charm to the film
  that made it immensely enjoyable to me.
