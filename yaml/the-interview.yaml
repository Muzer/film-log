  Surprisingly better than expected. It was VERY low-brow as expected, but
  fortunately I was in just the right mood for some "switch off your brain"
  low-brow comedy so that worked well for me. I think for low-brow humour it
  was surprisingly funny, and it actually had a semi-intelligent message as
  well. Some of the setups earlier in the plot were rather predictable, but
  there were a few payoffs that I didn't see coming (though there did also
  appear to be some setups that really didn't go anywhere). The characters were
  as you'd expect in a film like this — mostly one-dimensional caricatures —
  but some of them seemed to have more depth. In all, would have been a
  half-decent but forgettable low-brow comedy if it weren't for all the
  attention it received!
