  I liked this film. It had some flaws, but it was on the whole good. The pace
  was outstandingly good, the film never leaving you bored with the status quo
  but also never making too fast/unbelievable a jump in character/plot
  development. The film's introduction, especially, lasted around two scenes
  before the main story started, which I would say is very rare. The characters
  seemed realistic, the acting was excellent, and the score and cinematography
  were good (at least, neither bad nor good enough for me to particularly
  notice). The main issue I had with this film was the ending. It seemed to
  just end â€” there was no closure, but the ending also wasn't shocking/exciting
  enough to quite warrant that. I think the final few scenes could have been
  cut down into something quite a bit tighter to improve this aspect, but I
  would be worried that would cause us to lose some good final scenes, so I'm
  really not sure what could have been done.
