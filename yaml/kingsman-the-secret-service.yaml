  Wonderfully enjoyable film, teetering on the edge between parody and genuine
  "James Bond" style classic spy film. You can see the joy of the filmmakers in
  the film itself, with some wonderfully ridiculous scenes set to a perfect
  score combined with genuinely tense and heartfelt moments. Outstandingly
  done, highly recommended.
