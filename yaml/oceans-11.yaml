  The plot was rather straightforward, though there were a couple of fun
  surprises. The real appeal of this film is in the interaction of the main
  cast with each other. The dialogue was mostly very believable and engaging.
  But the film is probably too long to rely on just this, I had to have a short
  break partway through to get through it. But it was still interesting and
  recommended.
