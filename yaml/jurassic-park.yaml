  Absolutely amazed. I always put off watching this film, for years, because I
  thought it would be a rather dull and brainless action-packed romp without
  much substance. How wrong I was.

  Let's start off with the negative points so I can get them out the way and
  end on a good note, because I did love this film. The dialogue was stupid in
  places, and the technology-related plotholes were plentiful. The technology
  in general was stupid and slightly scaremongery in places. And Jeff
  Goldblum's character I'm very torn on — he cracked me up, but mostly because
  he simply seemed so far from being an actual mathematician. He was written
  not like a mathematician but like a guy who turned up at a university one day
  and just kept pestering everyone until they gave him a doctorate to make him
  go away... So there was an element of "so bad it's good" confined simply to
  this one character, which is an oddity I don't think I've seen before.

  But there is so much to love about this film. The visuals while not quite on
  the level of the best films today still hold out and are absolutely stunning
  for their time. This combined with the brilliant direction of Spielberg and
  the brilliant music of John Williams really makes the film, in my opinion.
  You feel the astonishment and the wonder that the main characters must feel
  who have studied dinosaurs for all their lives and suddenly actually SEE
  them. It's an amazing feeling. Later when the dinosaurs are attacking the
  suspense and the atmosphere is all perfectly and beautifully timed.

  But it's not entirely about atmosphere. The film is also quite intelligent.
  Where it could so easily have taken easy routes out to make it a brainless
  action flick, it instead took the harder routes. It very rarely featured
  dinosaurs actually attacking — the first part of the film served to establish
  the location and the plot, then to slowly build up suspense. When the
  dinosaurs attacked, they created obstacles to the characters other than
  themselves — for example, there was one scene where they simply had to figure
  out how to get out of a tree without a car landing on them. This all worked
  beautifully to add realism and continue to build up suspense for the payoff
  of the raptors.

  The characters all feel human as well. With the exception of the fat security
  guy who is basically there for plot purposes, despite them not having
  particularly fleshed-out backstories, they all feel like reasonable people
  with reasonable aims. There is no real cartoonish villain behind the whole
  park just wanting to make money as you might expect. Instead the CEO is a
  normal guy who just got carried away and didn't really think hard enough
  about what he was doing. In conclusion, it's a wonderfully-crafted film and
  well deserving of its accolades.
