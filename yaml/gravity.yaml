  Meh, it wasn't as bad as I thought it might be. So it has a reasonable
  premise, but very little substance. We barely got to know the characters, and
  considering the lack of plot there really isn't any excuse for this. There
  were a few surprises, but it was all rather dull, slow and predictable.
  However, the visuals were, indeed, stunning. It's supposed to be sci-fi but
  to be honest since it was all modern technology, I don't really know why it's
  classified thus. Because it involves space? Isn't that a bit arbitrary? The
  characters were annoying me in the film and I really didn't engage with them
  as much as would be necessary to pull this sort of thing off well. However,
  its short length was its saving grace — it wasn't unwatchable, and I enjoyed
  myself thanks in the most part due to the effects much more than I did
  watching Interstellar. It was certainly much more technically and
  scientifically accurate than the latter — I honestly noticed very little off,
  with nothing bad enough to annoy me. I just think I should have had a much
  bigger emotional connection with the characters, which I didn't, and perhaps
  it would have worked better.

  Throughout the film I was actually thinking, wouldn't this be good as a
  horror film? With an Alien like vibe, but all contemporary technology. Would
  be pretty cool, a lot of the atmosphere was very conducive to the genre.
  Sadly this film just didn't make good use of that atmosphere.
