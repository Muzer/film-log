  Wow, after having read bits and bobs about this film, I was quite excited, it
  sounded as if it would more than live up to the original. Oh, how wrong I
  was. So this film has very little in common with the original besides name,
  which in itself is fine. But the film was also bad. Missing were the great
  character interactions of the original. In their place, we had a whole load
  of cringeworthy technobabble, and a rather stupid plot. The heist itself,
  which this time took up much of the film, was jam-packed with ridiculous
  heist film clich√©s, and played entirely straight with no real sense of
  suspense that the original managed in the final act. It was well-acted, but
  not as well as the original, and given the lack of other merit in this film,
  this is sorely missing. The whole film felt really generic and Hollywood, not
  at all deserving of the Ocean's Eleven name, without which it would have been
  a very forgettable heist film. As it is, I'm sorely disappointed.
