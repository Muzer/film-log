  I'd heard a lot about this film, and it was quite bad, but sadly I didn't
  find it as amusingly bad as I thought I might. I mean, it's probable I'm
  missing a lot of the historical context for the film. It was quite funny in
  its simple ineptitude â€” the clunky dialogue, the terrible sets and effects,
  and the terrible acting were all amusing, along with the stupid plot and
  dodgy science. But it did drag at times, and just wasn't that amusing in
  general. Meh.
