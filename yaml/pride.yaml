  Very good film. It was apparently very accurate which is important in this
  sort of film. It was funny when it needed to be without ever making light of
  the issues, and it was serious when it needed to be. You really felt for all
  the people involved, and really got the feel of solidarity. My only two
  complaints were that the first hour dragged a little and probably could have
  been condensed into half an hour or three quarters. My second complaint is
  the title â€” it didn't actually have that much to do with gay pride in and of
  itself! Only the gay pride marches that bookended the film fit in with the
  theme. But yeah, brilliant film, highly recommended.
